# Doge CSS

Create a single page site handrolling the css. This was designed by the lovely Louisa Barrett because if you know anything about me, I'm CSStupid.

## Tutorial
1. Create an index.html file and insert the html tags.
2. We'll begin with header. Insert the header opening and closing tag. Inside it, add a nav tag. We'll also add an unordered list (`ul`) with three `li` elements. Add some content into those li elements, and make them links (a tags).
3. Let's reset the default CSS that comes with your browser. I copied the simple reset file found [here](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/css/reset/reset.css), and then linked them in the `<head>` tag.
4. Now that we have reset the CSS, we can write our own CSS. Let's link that css file (I've called mine `style.css`)
5. Nav bar:
  * Make those li units display: inline-block
  * Float right that entire ul element
6. Oh no, why are does that h1 take up the whole page? h1's by default have the display block setting... So remove that by either using float or display: inline-block.
7. Make the things colorful! Look [here](https://color.adobe.com/explore/newest/) for some color themes if you are color challenged like me.
8. Also choose a fun font from [Google Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts), and copy the stylesheet link and place it before your custom stylesheet. We chose Slabo 27px as our font. NOTE: your load time will change depending on your fonts.
